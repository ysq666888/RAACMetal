The data for each ligand is stored in the sub-directory of "ligand" directory, and named by the ligand.
There are two files in each ligand directory:
The file "allid_reso3.0_len50_nr40.txt" lists the non-redundant PDB chains used in the study.
The file "allsulfate.txt" is a fasta-like sequence file, except that there is an additional label line for each sequence.
The labels are extracted from the BioLip database, where 0 indicates the non-binding residues and 1 indicates the binding residues.
Note that the labels are only valid for the specific PDB chain and the specific ligand.
